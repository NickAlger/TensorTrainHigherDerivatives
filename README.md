# TensorTrainFromTensorAction
## Purpose:
1) Construct a tensor train approximation of a tensor from actions of the tensor.
2) Compute the action of higher derivative tensors for quantities of interest that depend on the solution of PDEs.

## Dependencies:
1) numpy
2) scipy
3) collections_extended

For higher derivative PDE stuff:

4) fenics

For generating plots:

5) matplotlib

## Primary functionality:
1) Function for constructing tensor train from tensor actions (Section 2 in the paper):
    - tensor_train_from_tensor_action() 
    - tensor_train_from_tensor_action.py

2) Class for computing higher derivative actions (Section 3 in the paper):
    - class HigherDerivativesAction
    - higher_derivatives_action.py


## Examples:
1) Compressing a Hilbert tensor into tensor train format in:
    - EXAMPLE_hilbert.py

2) Constructing a tensor train Taylor series surrogate model for the noise-whitened parameter-to-output map for a stochastic reaction-diffusion equation with boundary output:
    - EXAMPLE_poisson.py
